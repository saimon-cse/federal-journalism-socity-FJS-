Okay, this is a big project! Let's create a comprehensive roadmap and discuss a clean file structure for maintainability and scalability.

**Project Roadmap: Integrated Organization Management System (IOMS)**

This roadmap breaks the project into phases and modules. It's recommended to tackle core functionalities first and then build outwards. Testing (unit, feature, integration) should be an ongoing process throughout each phase.

**Phase 0: Setup & Core Infrastructure (The Foundation)**

1.  **Project Initialization:**
    *   Install Laravel (latest stable).
    *   Configure `.env` file (database, mail, app URL, etc.).
    *   Initialize Git repository.
2.  **Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   Install and configure Laravel Breeze (or Jetstream, or build custom).
    *   Integrate Spatie Laravel Permission:
        *   Publish migrations and config.
        *   Define core roles (Super-Admin, Admin, Member, etc.) in a seeder.
        *   Define core permissions (e.g., `view-dashboard`, `manage-users`) and assign to roles.
3.  **User Management (Core):**
    *   Implement User Registration (with email verification).
    *   Implement User Login & Logout.
    *   Implement Password Reset functionality.
    *   Basic User Profile (view/edit for the logged-in user, initially focusing on `users` and `user_profiles` tables).
    *   Super-Admin: User listing, basic role assignment.
4.  **Basic Layout & UI:**
    *   Choose and integrate a frontend theme/template (e.g., AdminLTE, Tabler, or your custom Oxpins-based).
    *   Create basic layouts (app layout, auth layout, public layout).
    *   Setup basic navigation (sidebar, topbar).
5.  **Helper Utilities & Base Classes:**
    *   Create base Controller, Service, Repository classes if using that pattern.
    *   Setup helper functions or classes for common tasks.
6.  **Geographic Data:**
    *   Implement migrations for `divisions`, `districts`, `upazilas`.
    *   Create seeders to populate this data (essential for addresses).

**Phase 1: Core Modules - User & Membership Management**

1.  **User Profile Enhancement:**
    *   Full implementation of `user_profiles`, `user_addresses`, `user_education_records`, `user_professional_experiences`, `user_social_links`.
    *   Forms for users to update their extended profile information.
    *   Admin interface to view (and potentially manage, with permissions) full user profiles.
2.  **Membership Management:**
    *   **Application:**
        *   Form for registered users to apply for membership.
        *   Upload NID/required documents.
        *   Manual payment instructions for membership fee.
        *   Submission of payment proof (transaction ID, screenshot).
    *   **Admin Verification & Approval:**
        *   Admin/Finance Officer interface to view pending membership applications.
        *   Verify payment proof against `payments` table (which will be integrated with `membership_fees` payable).
        *   Approve/reject applications.
        *   On approval: Update `users.is_member`, `membership_start_date`, `membership_expires_on`. Assign 'Member' role.
    *   **Fee Tracking (`membership_fees` table):**
        *   System to generate upcoming fee records (e.g., monthly, annually).
        *   Members can see their due fees and payment history.
        *   Admin can track paid/unpaid fees.
    *   **Member Dashboard:**
        *   Display membership status, fee history.
        *   Access to member-only sections.
3.  **Payment System (Manual Verification - Initial):**
    *   Implement `payment_accounts` table (Admin can add org's bank/mobile money accounts).
    *   Implement `payments` table:
        *   Polymorphic relationship setup (`payable_type`, `payable_id`).
        *   When a user submits payment proof for *any* payable item (membership, training, event), a record is created here.
        *   Admin/Finance Officer interface to view pending payments, verify, and mark as 'verified' or 'rejected'.
        *   On verification, update the status of the related `payable` item (e.g., `TrainingRegistration.status` to 'approved').

**Phase 2: Resource Person & Training Management**

**Explanation of Key Custom Directories:**

*   **`app/Actions/`**: For single-action classes that encapsulate a specific piece of business logic. Useful if a controller method gets too complex or the logic is reusable.
*   **`app/Enums/`**: If you're on PHP 8.1+, this is the place for your enums (e.g., `PaymentStatus::PENDING`, `UserType::MEMBER`).
*   **`app/Exports/` & `app/Imports/`**: If using Laravel Excel or similar for data import/export.
*   **`app/Http/Controllers/Admin/`**, **`app/Http/Controllers/Api/`**, **`app/Http/Controllers/Frontend/`**: Grouping controllers by their area of responsibility makes navigation easier.
*   **`app/Http/Requests/Admin/`**: Similarly, group Form Request classes.
*   **`app/Services/`**: This is a common pattern to extract business logic from controllers. Services can be injected into controllers. Each service might handle logic for a specific domain (e.g., `PaymentService` handles all payment processing logic). This promotes DRY and makes controllers thinner.
*   **`app/Traits/`**: For reusable pieces of code that can be mixed into multiple classes (e.g., a trait for handling image uploads used by multiple models).
*   **`app/View/Composers/` & `app/View/Components/`**: Standard Laravel directories for view logic and reusable Blade components.
*   **`database/seeders/`**: Keep your seeders organized.
*   **`resources/views/admin/`**, **`resources/views/frontend/`**: Separate Blade views for different parts of your application.
*   **`routes/admin.php`**, **`routes/frontend.php`**: Splitting routes into multiple files (loaded via `RouteServiceProvider`) keeps your `web.php` and `api.php` cleaner.

**Key Principles for Clean Code:**

*   **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class and method should have one clear purpose.
*   **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Use services, traits, helpers, Blade components to avoid code duplication.
*   **Fat Models, Skinny Controllers:** Put query scopes, accessors, mutators, and model-specific logic in your Eloquent models. Controllers should primarily handle HTTP requests/responses and delegate business logic.
*   **Use Form Requests for Validation:** Keeps validation logic out of controllers.
*   **Use Policies for Authorization:** Keeps authorization logic clean and organized.
*   **Events and Listeners:** For decoupling parts of your application (e.g., when a user registers, fire an event, and a listener sends a welcome email).
*   **Service Layer (Optional but Recommended for Large Apps):** As mentioned, for complex business logic.
*   **Consistent Naming Conventions.**
*   **Write Tests!** Unit and Feature tests are crucial for maintainability and catching regressions.
*   **Code Comments:** Explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions.

This roadmap and file structure provide a solid foundation. Remember to adapt it to your team's preferences and the specific evolving needs of the project. Good luck!
